### ✅ Story 1.2: Primary Charts (Charts 1-3)
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ **Chart 1**: Stunting Category Progress (Grouped Bar Chart)
  - Shows first measurement vs last measurement vs target goals
  - 3 categories: At Risk, Stunted, Severely Stunted
  - Uses Plotly grouped bar chart with proper styling
  - Includes target goal bars for comparison
- ✅ **Chart 2**: Number of Children by Category (Grouped Bar Chart)
  - Similar to Chart 1 but with absolute counts instead of percentages
  - Shows actual numbers of children in each category
- ✅ **Chart 3**: Temporal Trends (Dual-axis Area + Line Chart)
  - Quarterly aggregated data
  - Shows measurement volume (area chart) and stunting rate (line chart)
  - Dual Y-axes for different metrics
- ✅ Added AI interpretation button placeholders for each chart
- ✅ Implemented chart export functionality (PNG/PDF)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used Plotly for all visualizations with consistent styling
- Implemented quarterly aggregation for temporal data
- Added proper axis labels and legends
- Used color palette from PRD: Orange (#F6AD55) for At Risk, Coral (#FC8181) for Stunted, Red (#E53E3E) for Severely Stunted
- Added loading states during data processing

### ✅ Story 1.3: Secondary Charts (Charts 4-6)
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ **Chart 4**: Top Sites by Children Measured (Horizontal Bar Chart)
  - Shows top 10 sites by number of children measured
  - Sorted by children count in descending order
  - Uses horizontal bar chart for better readability
- ✅ **Chart 5**: Program Distribution (Pie Chart)
  - Shows distribution by SITE_GROUP with percentages
  - Uses consistent color palette
  - Displays labels with percentages
- ✅ **Chart 6**: WHO Z-Score Distribution (Line Chart)
  - Creates histogram bins of WHO_INDEX values
  - Adds reference lines at -3, -2, and 0 (WHO thresholds)
  - Shows distribution curve with markers
- ✅ Styled all charts consistently with PRD color palette
- ✅ Added export functionality for all charts
- ✅ Implemented responsive design for mobile devices

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used Plotly for consistent styling across all charts
- Implemented proper binning for histogram data
- Added reference lines for WHO standards
- Ensured charts are responsive and readable on all devices
- Added tooltips with detailed information

- **AI Integration Ready**: Placeholder buttons for Epic 4 AI features

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing
- **Data Caching**: Streamlit caching to prevent redundant database calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded only when needed
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

## 📊 Data Structure & Queries

### Key Metrics Queries:
- Total unique children measured
- Active sites count
- Average WHO Z-Score calculation
- Stunting reduction percentage (first vs last measurement)

### Chart Data Queries:
- **Stunting Categories**: First/last measurement comparison with target goals
- **Temporal Trends**: Quarterly aggregation of measurements and stunting rates
- **Geographic Data**: Top sites by children measured
- **Program Distribution**: Site group percentages
- **Z-Score Distribution**: Histogram bins with WHO reference lines

## 🎯 Epic Success Criteria - All Met

- ✅ All 4 metric cards display accurate data with proper styling
- ✅ All 6 charts render correctly with proper data
- ✅ Charts are interactive and responsive
- ✅ AI interpretation buttons are present (functionality in Epic 4)
- ✅ Export functionality works for all charts
- ✅ Page loads within 3 seconds (with caching)
- ✅ Mobile layout is functional

## 🔄 Next Steps

The Overview page is now ready for the next epics:
